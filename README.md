## SMART CVD Risk Example App

This is a simple example of a CVD risk calculator that uses [FHIR](https://hl7.org/fhir) and the 
[Smart App Launch Framework](https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/).

It is designed to be launched from a FHIR/SMART enabled application such as an EHR. It makes a 
series of requests to the FHIR endpoint to prefill the form with available patient data. Finally, 
the app can write a risk score observation back into the system, again using the FHIR endpoint.

It is written using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Material UI](https://mui.com/). You can run 
it locally using the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

This is an example only, and should not be used for any sort of production purpose.
